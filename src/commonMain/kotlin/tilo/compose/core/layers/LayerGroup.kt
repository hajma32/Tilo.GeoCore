/**
 * A composite layer that keeps multiple child layers in one ordered map-layer slot.
 *
 * [zIndex] orders the complete group among its siblings. Child layer z-indices are local to this
 * group, so layers outside the group never interleave with its children. Group visibility and zoom
 * limits apply to every descendant in addition to each descendant's own constraints. Group opacity
 * is multiplied with each descendant's opacity.
 *
 * Child layer IDs remain globally unique within a map. Grouping a layer does not change its ID.
